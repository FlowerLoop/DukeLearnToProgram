# Image Filter Project

Final project of the coursera course **Programming Foundations with JavaScript**, HTML and CSS from Duke University, at Coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web.

The user can upload a picture which will be displayed on the page and subsequently apply filters to it. The filters are applied on top of each other until the user presses the 
reset button which returns the picture to the one that was uploaded.

This project uses the SimpleImage library provided in the course which was not developed by me.
